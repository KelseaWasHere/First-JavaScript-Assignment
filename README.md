# First-JavaScript-Assignment  
The first assignment completed in my Computer Graphics class. 

Description: 
A. Create a JavaScript program that will have a main class that will store information about the
lucky number game and contains the playGame() function.

B. When a player pushes an HTML button, it will call back to a global function (Not the main class),
which will then invoke the playGame function from the instance of the main class
  a. NOTE: this is necessary due to a limitation with JavaScript.
  
C. Inside the playGame() function - get a random number between 1 and 100, get a second random
number between 1 and 100, if the 2nd number is higher print "You Win", otherwise print you lose.
(Also print the numbers).
  a. (NOTE: When I say print I mean to write to the innerHTML of a section in the website).
  b. You will keep track of how often you have one or lost. (Keep in mind you will NOT
have to refresh)

c. The won and lost counters can be class variables.

D. If you have won more than lost display a picture of a happy face (using JavaScript to change the
src inside of an img tag)
  a. Otherwise, display an unhappy face. (If you want a special face for win == lose you
may add it.)

This assignment was completed using JavaScript within HTML.
